# TechRoom
TechRoom is a technology-based ecommerce website which allows users to browse laptops, tablets, phones and accessories and check out real-time cart data using Stripe's API payment gateway. A NoSQL database (MongoDB) was used to store product information and insights. 
The home page  allows users to view the latest products added to inventory. Admins have specialized priveleges to add, remove, edit and update product data. They also have access to an order tracking and management page.
Middleware using Passport and sessions was developed to authenticate both consumers and admins!
