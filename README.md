#TechRoom

TechRoom is a platform that brings together technology products in one accessible space. Consumers can browse, purchase and create reviews on laptops, tablets, mobile devices and accessories.

TechRoom's homepage reflects the very latest products added to inventory for consumers to explore. I've also integrated Stripe's API payment gateway, which ensures that every transaction is swift and secure. Adminstrators have access to a wide variety of tools such as product management, updates and real-time order tracking, making the interface both intuitive and comprehensive. Through Passport and session-based middleware, I was able to authenticate consumer and admin accounts upon login. I used a NoSQL database (MongoDB) in order to store product insights, user information, reviews and orders made.
